# Simple-Cucumber-Selenide-Tests

Simple automation test using Selenide, Cucumber and a bit of JUnit.

In this repository you will find a single .feature file with 10 scenarios that can be used as a small regression suite for your home-page.

The code is commented wherever deemed necessary to explain each functionality or descision.

## Notes

I do not hate anything more than sleep(); method. But a combination of my slow laptop with some long loading funcionalities of the website made it inevitable.
I am sure that given I had access to a test environment this problem would not exist and also the scenarios would be a lot more interesting (checks against db,
endpoints etc.)

Regarding the technologies used, I deviated a bit from what was asked and replaces Selenium with Selenide, which is a more simplified version of Selenium that I
use for the last 6 months. We can discuss this further.

## Getting Started
